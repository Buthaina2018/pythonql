Project TODO List:

  1. First we want to get feedback on the language and fix the syntax
  2. Get enough scenarious/use-cases done, so we're sure the language is good and is useful
  3. Rewrite the current parser
    3.1. We need a faster parser
    3.2. We need much better error reporting, on par with Python's
  4. Make PythonQL encoding and create a pypy repository for PythonQL
  5. Write PythonQL documentation
  6. Add some wrappers for different databases (relational,MongoDB,CouchDB,Spark)
