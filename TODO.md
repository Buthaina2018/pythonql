Project TODO List:

  1. First we want to get feedback on the language and fix the syntax
  
  2. Get enough scenarious/use-cases done, so we're sure the language is good and is useful
  
  3. Rewrite the current parser
  
    3.1. We need a faster parser
    
    3.2. We need much better error reporting, on par with Python's
      
  4. Write PythonQL documentation
  
  5. Add some wrappers for different databases (relational,MongoDB,CouchDB,Spark)
  
  6. Build an optimizer and a mediator that would keep up-to-date statistics about data sources
  
  7. Build a fast query engine in C++ or Cython.
